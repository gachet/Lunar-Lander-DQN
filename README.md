# Deep Q Network - LunarLander OpenAI Gym environment

The goal of this repository is to study relatively in depth value-based Reinforcement Learning algorithms using deep neural networks as function approximators. We're gonna use Deep Q-Network algorithm and different improvements to solve the OpenAI Gym [LunarLander](https://gym.openai.com/envs/LunarLander-v2/) environment.
